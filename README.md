In this project I implemented A star algorithm.A * algorithm is a searching algorithm that searches for the shortest path
between the initial and the final state. It is used in various applications,such as maps.In maps, the A* algorithm calculates the shortest distance between the source (initial state) and the destination (final state).A* Algorithm is one of the best and most popular techniques for pathfinding and graph traversals.A lot of games and web-based maps use this algorithm for finding the
shortest path efficiently.It is essentially a best-first search algorithm.Let us examine a well-known problem that can be solved using the A* search algorithm:
The pathfinding problem on a grid. We'll specifically look into locating, on a 2D grid,the shortest path that avoids obstacles from a starting point to a goal point. The problem statement is as follows:
A 2D grid representing a terrain, a starting point (initial node) on the grid, and a goal point (target node) on the grid are givenâ€”the locations of obstacles on the grid that cannot be traversed. Our task is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point while avoiding obstacles. Movement is allowed only in the horizontal or vertical direction (no diagonal movement). Minimising the total cost of traversing cells from the starting point to the goal point while avoiding obstacles is the objective of the algorithm. The A* search algorithm will be used to explore possible paths efficiently.
